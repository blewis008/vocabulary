# vocabulary.js (beta)

What makes the Wu Tang Clan so special? It's a combination of their style, creativity, intelligence, and especially their vocabulary. The amazing depth of word choice makes them the ultimate in expressiveness.

vocabulary.js is an attempt at a similar elegance. It's a library that turns common and ubiquitous Javascript logic into tiny, re-usable functions. Don't bother memorizing implementations or searching Stack Overflow - just learn the function names.

Number of functions: **74**

### How is this different than lodash or Underscore?

If lodash and Underscore are utility belts, then vocabulary.js is like a team of Batmans wearing utility belts.

## Usage

If you don't want the whole library, feel free to copy and paste the functions from the source!

## Browser Support

Most functions should work in IE 9 or above. No attempt was made to make IE 8 or below work.

## Dependencies

None, unless you use one of the handful of functions that have external depedencies: `enableEs6` and `enableJsx`

## Versions

*Beta* - missing: tests, API documentation, consistent naming of functions, organization, and structure (maybe beta is an optimistic word)
